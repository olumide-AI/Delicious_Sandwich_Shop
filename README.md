 ## OOP Concepts
Abstraction: MenuItem and Topping are abstract superclasses

Inheritance: SignatureSandwich, PremiumTopping extend base classes

Polymorphism: Receipt uses shared interfaces for all MenuItems

Encapsulation: Order contains item logic and total calculations

 ## Signature Sandwiches
Predefined sandwiches available:
- BLT
- Philly Cheese Steak
- Buffalo Chicken
- Turkey Club
- Veggie Delight
- Maaike's Special
These extend the SignatureSandwich class and can be customized further!

## Unit Testing
JUnit tests exist for:
- SandwichTest
- DrinkTest
- ChipTest
- OrderTest
- ToppingTest
