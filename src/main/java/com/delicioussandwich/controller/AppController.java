  new order takes a scanner, since it needs input from user
  * if user input is 0, prints out a message, the flag is now false and while loop will stop running the app
  * if neither option is selcted the default is set to print out an error message and app will continue running
  since flag is still set to true
  * We used java "arrow" syntax, it's better for error handling and we don't need a break statement
  * each arrow branch is treated as a self-contained action. Once that statement (or block) runs,
  control automatically exits the switch. Thereâ€™s no falling through,
